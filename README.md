# SS 2.0 prettier
My custom SS version that changes the DOM on page load.

## Included:
- A more responsive start screen.
- Custom themes!! And an easy way to add new themes
- Smartschool ux improvments and better icons!
- wayyy more

## Install:
Can be installed with the [Scripty](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scripty-javascript-inject/milkbiaeapddfnpenedfgbfdacpbcbam) (or any JS injector) extension or with the Chrome Devtools "local overrides" (but this requires the Devtools to be open when you load the page).
